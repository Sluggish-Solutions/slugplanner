    "title": "Economic Applications of Machine Learning",
    "description": "Introduces machine learning methods and their application to econometrics and applied economics. Covers the traditional use of machine learning for solving prediction problems and recent research applying the methods to causal inference and counterfactual prediction. Students learn the basic theory justifying the use of these methods and gain experience implementing them in R using economic data. Through class discussions, students study examples of applied economic research utilizing machine learning methods.",
