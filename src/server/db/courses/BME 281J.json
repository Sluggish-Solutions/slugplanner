    "description": "Research seminar of the UCSC Computational Genomic Laboratory and Platform Teams. Students receive hands-on instruction in modern computational methods to address research questions. Topics include: genomic and transcriptomic sequence analysis methods, comparative and evolutionary genomics, big-data genomic analysis, biomedical data sharing, and precision medicine. Students attend and participate in monthly lab meetings, monthly all-hands meetings, where students give a quick report on their progress and the next month's goals, and a bi-weekly journal club, where pairs of students present and discuss a paper of their choosing with the lab. Students also participate in hands-on, active computational laboratory-based research. Student evaluation is based on suitable progress toward research goals and graduate program progress.\n May be repeated for credit.",
