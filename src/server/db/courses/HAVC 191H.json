    "title": "Climate Havoc: Art and Environmental Crisis Today",
    "description": "Examines contemporary art visual culture in relation to climate havoc. Climate-change threats and impacts grow more widespread, frequent, and severe wreaking environmental havoc worldwide. In the absence of effective governance and international leadership in addressing adequate solutions, artists and activists are inventing and participating in creative strategies of consciousness-raising, mass mobilization, and ecologically sustainable modes of thinking and living. Seminar focuses on creative practices of climate justice, considering ecological transformation in relation to justice-oriented frameworks that both stress socio-political and economic inequities, and seek ways to rectify such inequalities. Also maps out new trajectories of practice and methodologies of scholarship at the convergence of art history, visual cultural studies, and climate breakdown.",
