    "description": "Reading seminar that focuses on current research aimed at understanding interactions between solid Earth geodynamics and components of the Earth's climate system. Focuses on three main solid Earth processes: (1) mantle convection and dynamic topography; (2) glacial isostatic adjustment; and (3) tectonics processes. Considers the ways that Earth's landscape, atmosphere, and cryosphere respond to these geodynamic processes and vice versa. Possible topics include past sea-level and ice sheet inferences, passive margin earthquakes and submarine landslides, river and landscape evolution, and marine-terminating glacier dynamics.",
