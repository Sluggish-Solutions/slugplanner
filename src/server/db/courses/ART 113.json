    "description": "This drawing/painting class is taught using New Yorker magazine covers as examples of illustration at a level of excellence that is accessible and which are examined for content and formal qualities. Work is done in drawing and painting media; some digital and mixed media may be incorporated. Painting will be water-based. Wit, humor, restraint, and sophistication are discussed, as well as inclusivity, exclusivity, and explicit and implicit social issues. May be repeated for credit.",
