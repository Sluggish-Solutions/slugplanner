    "description": "Technologies involved in mechatronics (intelligent electro-mechanical systems) and techniques necessary to integrate these technologies into mechatronic systems. Topics include electronics (A/D, D/A converters, opamps, filters, power devices), software program design (event-driven programming, state machine-based design), DC and stepper motors, basic sensing, and basic mechanical design (machine elements and mechanical CAD). Combines lab component of structured assignments with a large and open-ended team project. Students who enrolled in this class will learn how to solve engineering problems using the C Programming Language. Cannot receive credit for this course and ECE 218.",
