    "description": "Focuses on enabling students to assess and communicate their learning in global and community health (GCH) using an iterative process of writing, review, and website development. The e-portfolio webpages students complete by the end of the course will together comprise their capstone ''GCH e-Record'' designed to communicate their disciplinary and interdisciplinary learning in their degree to a specific audience beyond the university.  These written reflections, in turn, involve meta-learning about how expert knowledge moves between different communities, and about how audience expectations and writing conventions condition communications about health expertise in particular. May be repeated for credit.",
