    "title": "Whiteness in Latin America",
    "description": "Examines whiteness in Latin America as a racial identity, a social condition, a set of cultural practices, a dominant standpoint, and a hyper-valued ideal. Analyzes the meanings and applicability of such concepts as ordinary whiteness, aspirational whiteness, the narcissistic pact of whiteness, the racialization of class, among others. Scrutinizes the intersections of whiteness with class, gender, nation, and language. Readings cover a wide range of Latin American countries and fields including anthropology, sociology, communication, and media and cultural studies.",
