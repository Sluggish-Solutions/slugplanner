    "title": "Origins of Analytic Philosophy",
    "description": "Analytic philosophy remains the dominant philosophical style worldwide. As a style of philosophy, analytic philosophy places emphasis on logical form and on the use of logical structure as the key element for evaluating the normative status (the logical merits) of a specific position. The history of analytic philosophy remains key since core debates turn on the status of logic as a supposedly value-neutral tool. This impacts philosophical understanding regarding logic, mathematics, and the relation of these areas to the natural and social sciences.",
