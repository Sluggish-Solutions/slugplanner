Course examines the movements and politics that inspired the birth of Hip Hop as a form of art and music, the art and aesthetics of Hip Hop, and the musical styles that made Hip Hop music possible. The ways it speaks to youth and speaks about oppression, violence, identity, culture, and power are also considered, and Hip Hop as a form of cultural politics and activism toward social justice is explored.
