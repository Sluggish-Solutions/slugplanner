Lectures, discussions, and visiting artist talks introduce and explore contemporary art contexts, ideas, discourses, artworks, artists, and practices to build students' capacities to place their work in the world. Readings introduce and unfold ideas for discussion, and provide examples of writing formats and purposes as they relate to art practice.",
