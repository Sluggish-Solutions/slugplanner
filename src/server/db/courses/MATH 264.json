In Euclidean geometry: Radon transform; X-ray transform; attenuated X-ray transform (Novikov's inversion formula); weighted transforms. Same topics in different geometric contexts: homogeneous spaces, manifolds with boundary. Non-linear problems: boundary rigidity, lens rigidity, inverse problems for connections. MATH 148, MATH 204, MATH 205, MATH 206, and MATH 208, are recommended for preparation.",
