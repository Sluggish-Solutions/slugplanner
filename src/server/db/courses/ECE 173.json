    "title": "High-Speed Digital Design",
    "description": "Studies of analog circuit principles relevant to high-speed digital design: signal propagation, crosstalk, and electromagnetic interference. Topics include electrical characteristics of digital circuits, interfacing different logic families, measurement techniques, distributed circuits and transmission lines, ground planes and grounding, terminations, power systems, electromagnetic compatibility and noise suppression. Laboratory sequence illustrates fundamental lecture topics and includes completion of a final design project.",
