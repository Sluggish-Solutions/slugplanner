In this hybrid creative writing, art making, and theory class we take an in-depth look at the politics of creative writing. We also engage in art-making practices that develop our understanding of political art or \"artivism\" more broadly while allowing us time and space for expression, to culminate in group projects and creative writing activities that interact with the broader campus environment. Students are encouraged to come prepared to write creatively, and with a desire to engage in other expressive arts that include drawing, phone photography, and music-making/sound.",
