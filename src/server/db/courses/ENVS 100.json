    "description": "Introduction to environmental issues in an interdisciplinary matrix. Focuses on three issues at the intersection of ecological questions and social institutions: agroecology and sustainable agriculture; population growth, economic growth, and environmental degradation; and biodiversity conservation and land management. Reviews the important roles of disciplinary abstraction and of the application of that knowledge to context-dependent explanations of environmental problems.",
