This course examines the enormous appeal of the ancient Greek tragic and comic visions from their inception through their enthusiastic adaptation by the Romans and on into the Middle Ages. For comparison purposes, Greek and Roman dramas are studied back-to-back with the contemporary non-Western dramatic forms of Noh and ancient Sanskrit drama.",
