    "description": "How can art make change? How can changing culture contribute to broader movements for social change? How can artists make games that move culture and society? Course approaches games as a site for political expression and social change. Looks at game makers who identify as feminist, queer, disabled, Black, Indigenous, people of color, workers, radicals, artists, scholars, and/or activists who are using games to drive social commentary, critical play, and political action. By the end of this course, students have a strong understanding of games as a political medium as demonstrated by the design of their own cultural intervention using games and play.",
