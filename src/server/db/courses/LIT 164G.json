It focuses on two major questions: first, what is left--from philosophical, existential, and religious perspectives--for language and imagination after the experience of humanity?s complete annihilation that was systematically pursued in the concentration camps of Nazi-occupied Europe, in which six million Jews were murdered; second, it investigates how categories of ethnicity and race were constructed and exploited through systemic racism in the construction of modern nationalisms and fascist regimes. We will also observe how the traumatic experience of persecution prompted original philosophical, religious, and even `mystical? thinking. Our focus will be on literature - both poetry and prose - and films that either provide historical and autobiographical accounts of the Holocaust or recount fictional stories inspired by this event. We will discuss primary sources from a wide variety of genres, including memorial books, poetry, fictional novels, a diary, essays, studies, a graphic novel, and films, by authors from Italy, Romania, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States. In addition, we will be reading secondary sources that will help us assess the historical events and the critical questions that are at the center of Holocaust literature.",
