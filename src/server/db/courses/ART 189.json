Up to 90% of the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is related to animal farming and soybean monoculture to feed the cattle. If the way we have been growing food is questionable, so are our demands as eaters. What we eat shapes entire ecosystems and societies, meaning our food choices have a transformative ability. This course will focus on politicizing our tastes so that we are eating with, and not against, the planet. We will share meals, visit farms, cook together and investigate the image of our digestive systems as sculpting tools that may shape the Earth and satisfy our hunger for social and environmental justice.",
