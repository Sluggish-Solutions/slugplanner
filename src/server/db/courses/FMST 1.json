    "title": "Feminist Studies: An Introduction",
    "description": "Introduces the core concepts underlying the interdisciplinary field-formation of feminist studies within multiple geopolitical contexts. Explores how feminist inquiry rethinks disciplinary assumptions and categories, and animates our engagement with culture, history, and society. Topics include: the social construction of gender; the gendered division of labor, production, and reproduction; intersections of gender, race, class, and ethnicity; and histories of sexuality.",
