    "title": "Foundations of Modern Cryptography",
    "description": "Focuses on foundational aspects of modern cryptography, namely, private and public key cryptography; digital signatures; pseudorandom generators and functions/permutations; message authentication codes; hash functions; and random oracles, certificates and public-key infrastructures. Also connects the formal concepts with real-world applications. Students are exposed to general concepts of probability theory, number theory, and rigorous proofs. Assumes background on proofs, discrete probability, and modular arithmetic as well as programming in C/C++ or Python. Prerequisite(s): CSE 201 is recommended. Enrollment is restricted to graduate students and requires instructor permission.",
