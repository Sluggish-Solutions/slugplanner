Through hands-on practice, this course introduces high-performance parallel computing, including the concepts of multiprocessor machines and parallel computation, and the hardware and software tools associated with them. Students become familiar with parallel concepts and the use of MPI and OpenMP together with some insight into the use of heterogeneous architectures (CPU, CUDA, OpenCL), and some case-study problems.
