    "description": "An introduction to communication systems. Analysis and design of communication systems based on radio, transmission lines, and fiber optics. Topics include fundamentals of analog and digital signal transmission in the context of baseband communications, including concepts such as modulation and demodulation techniques, multiplexing and multiple access, channel loss, distortion, bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratios and error control. Digital communication concepts include an introduction to sampling and quantization, transmission coding and error control.  (Formerly EE 151.)",
