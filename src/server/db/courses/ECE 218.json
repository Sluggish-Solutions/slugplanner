    "description": "Examines technologies involved in mechatronics (intelligent electro-mechanical systems)and techniques necessary to integrate these technologies. Topics include electronics (A/D, D/A converters, opamps, filters, power devices), software program design (event-driven programming, state machine-based design), DC and stepper motors, basic sensing, and basic mechanical design (machine elements and mechanical CAD). Students learn how to solve engineering problems using C Programming Language. Combines lab component of structured assignments with a large and open-ended team project. Students cannot receive credit for this course and ECE 118.",
