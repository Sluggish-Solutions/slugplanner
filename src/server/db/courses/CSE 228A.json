    "description": "Agile Hardware Design techniques take the best of software engineering methods and apply them to improve hardware design productivity. Agile approaches not only reduce the time to solution, but they can also produce solutions which are better tailored for their target problems. In this synchronous in-person course, these techniques are covered while taking advantage of the Chisel hardware design language which brings the strengths of functional object-oriented programming to hardware design. Course consists of engaging lectures (intermixed coding demos and guest speakers) and progressive design assignments that culminate in a small project.",
