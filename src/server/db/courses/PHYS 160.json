    "title": "Practical Electronics",
    "description": "Provides a practical knowledge of analog electronics that experimentalists generally need in research, including basic circuits with bipolar and field-effect transistors, op-amps, comparators, oscillators, and voltage regulators. It assumes no previous knowledge of electronics but includes twice-weekly lectures with some homework assignments, including small circuit simulations done using PSpice. However, with the aid of the instructor and teaching assistant, the students are expected to learn mainly through the construction, debugging, and analysis of small electronics projects.",
