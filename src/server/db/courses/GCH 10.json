    "description": "Takes as its topic the still-unfolding story of COVID-19, its historical precursors, evolving scientific and policy questions, and present global challenges. It invites students from across disciplines to examine the medical, cultural, and public health concepts necessary in a post-pandemic world, and to explore the vital importance of rhetoric, representation, and narrative in the cultural politics of COVID more generally. A project-based, collaborative approach guides hands-on investigations to help students become audiences and advocates for health initiatives worldwide.",
