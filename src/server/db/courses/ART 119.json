Beginning with an observational drawing approach, students will gain confidence in perceptual drawing practices that lead to more personal, thematic, and conceptual directions. Topics such as linear perspective, notan, and decolonization will be scrutinized while exploring a range of drawing materials from charcoal to ink wash. A lightweight field easel will be required to facilitate working at full scale.",
