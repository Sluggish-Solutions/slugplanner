    "description": "Small, discussion-based seminar held in conjunction with The Humanities Institute's community reading initiative, The Deep Read. The Deep Read aims to bring together UCSC undergraduates, faculty, and alumni to discuss and think deeply about a text and its key themes and issues. Course is a comprehensive study of The Deep Read book, the author's work, and its relevant contexts. While the textual analysis framework remains consistent every year, the topic, author, and key text changes each year. May be repeated for credit.",
