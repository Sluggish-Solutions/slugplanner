    "description": "Introduction to hypothesis-driven laboratory research. Students collectively design and execute a novel research project that addresses a question about macromolecular structure, function, or regulation. Working individually and in small groups, students learn aspects of experimental design, literature and public data base research, data analysis and interpretation, and scientific collaboration. Learned laboratory techniques include molecular cloning, recombinant protein expression and purification, and biochemical assay implementation.",
