    "title": "Advanced Analog Integrated Circuits",
    "description": "Analog integrated circuit design with emphasis on fundamentals of designing linear circuits using CMOS. Covers MOS devices and device modeling, current mirrors, op-amp design, op-amp compensation, comparators, multipliers, voltage references, sample-and-holds, noise, and an introduction to more complicated systems using these building blocks, such as phase locked loops and analog-to-digital converters. If time permits, integrated circuit layout issues and device/circuit fabrication. Students cannot receive credit for this course and ECE 172.  (Formerly EE 221.)",
