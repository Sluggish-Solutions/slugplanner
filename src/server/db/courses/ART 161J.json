    "description": "Course taught both at UCSC and at the host university in Tokyo. At UCSC, oil-based woodblock printmaking covers techniques, application of tools, materials, history, issues and concepts. In Japan, the class studies Mokuhanga, resulting in a great understanding and appreciation of this traditional process. Via class activities, field trips, excursions, and cultural visits, students encounter diverse multi-regional art practices, thus broadening perspectives and increasing understanding not only of print media but of contemporary visual culture. May be repeated for credit.",
