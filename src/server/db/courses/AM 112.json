    "description": "Focuses on analytical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) of two variables, including: the method of characteristics for first-order PDEs; classification of second-order PDEs; separation of variables; Sturm-Liouville theory; and Green's functions. Illustrates each method using applications taken from examples in physics. Students cannot receive credit for this course and AM 212A.",
