Covers models of arbitrary articulated robotic or biological arms and their application to realistic arms and tasks, including the homogeneous coordinate model of positioning tasks; the forward and inverse kinematic models; the Jacobian matrix; trajectory generation;and dynamic models, including Newton-Euler and Lagrangian formulations.
