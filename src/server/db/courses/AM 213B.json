    "title": "Numerical Methods for the Solution of Differential Equations",
    "description": "Introduces the numerical solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs and PDEs). Focuses on the derivation of discrete solution methods for a variety of differential equations, and their stability and convergence. Also provides hands-on experience in implementing such numerical algorithms for the solution of engineering and scientific problems using MATLAB software. The  class consists of lectures and hands-on programming sections. Basic mathematical knowledge of ODEs and PDEs is assumed, and a basic working knowledge of programming in MATLAB is expected.
