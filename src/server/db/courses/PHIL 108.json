Through it, we'll discuss the Arendtian take on 'the political,' the arts, science, technology, and nature's exploitation. In order to do so, the course is organized around the two central themes of Arendt's thought: \"Vita Activa,\" the life of 'action and speech' and \"Vita Contemplativa,\" the life of 'thought.' Readings will be drawn from \"The Human Condition,\" \"The Life of the Mind,\" lectures, and short essays.",
