As a methodology, autoethnography situates the personal experiences of a researcher in structural and collective terms. We devote particular attention to legacies of autoethnography in critical sociology, critical geography, and interdisciplinary Black feminist thought, among other traditions. With a focus on reading and crafting autoethnography, this seminar considers its possibilities and critiques. By engaging with emerging forms of autoethnography - including arts-based and somatic approaches - we will address still broader questions about ways of knowing or epistemologies, the philosophy of (Western) science, and the politics of research.",
