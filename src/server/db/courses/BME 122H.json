    "description": "Examines life in extreme environments with an emphasis on the viruses that live there. Integrates aspects of virology, molecular biology, and computational biology. Students investigate a high-salt, extreme environment at the Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge, and use DNA extraction methods to find molecular evidence of the organisms that live there and describe the genetic content of viruses and the community living in those high-salt ponds.",
