    "description": "Focuses on numerical solutions to classic problems of linear algebra. Topics include: LU, Cholesky, and QR factorizations; iterative methods for linear equations; least square, power methods, and QR algorithms for eigenvalue problems; and conditioning and stability of numerical algorithms. Provides hands-on experience in implementing numerical algorithms for solving engineering and scientific problems. Basic knowledge of mathematical linear algebra is assumed. (Formerly AMS  213A.)",
