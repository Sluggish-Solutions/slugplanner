    "description": "Matlab is a powerful and widely used programming language to design stimuli, collect behavioral data, conduct statistical analyses, and visualize results. This course provides students with basic tools to use Matlab in a range of cognitive science applications. The course includes in-class coding, weekly assignments, and a term project in which students write a program to analyze, collect, or visualize a dataset or model a cognitive phenomenon. No previous programming experience is required. Topics include modeling of cognitive and neural processes and principal components analysis.",
