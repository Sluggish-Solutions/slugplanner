    "title": "Computational Fluid Dynamics",
    "description": "Introduces modern computational approaches to solving the differential equations that arise in fluid dynamics, particularly for problems involving discontinuities and shock waves. Examines the fundamentals of the mathematical foundations and computation methods to obtain solutions. Focuses on writing practical numerical codes and analyzing their results for a full understanding of fluid phenomena. (Formerly AMS 260.)",
