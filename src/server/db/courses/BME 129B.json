    "description": "Second part of a three-course sequence that is the culmination of the bioengineering program for students who chose a senior design group project to fulfill their capstone requirement. Students apply knowledge and skills gained in biomolecular engineering coursework to articulate, organize, and plan a senior design group project. Student groups complete research, specification, planning, and procurement for their project. Includes technical discussions, design reviews, and formal presentations.",
