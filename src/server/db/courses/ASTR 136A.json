    "description": "Students use the Nickel telescope at Lick Observatory to measure the astrometry, or position, of a solar system body across multiple nights. By measuring the body's motion, students determine its distance from the Earth using parallax. This course is part of the ASTR 136 collection of 2-credit advanced labs. Class meets in person over a three-week period and includes an overnight field trip to Lick Observatory.",
