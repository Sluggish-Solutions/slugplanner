    "description": "The basic theory of time-dependent processes is covered at an advanced level. The interaction of electromagnetic radiation and matter is described using both semiclassical and quantum field formulations. A variety of modern spectroscopic techniques are discussed both in terms of the basic processes and their use in the elucidation of chemical structure and dynamics.",
