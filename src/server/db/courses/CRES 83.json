Students think through the genealogy of whiteness studies and its origins in Black studies and movements to gain ethnic studies programs on campuses in California. Also considers the position of whiteness studies within the fields of critical race and ethnic studies, gender and sexuality studies, and political economy. It is important to note that this course is less a critical response to whiteness studies than an introduction to and survey of the field.",
