Towards this, students will read, present and critically analyze papers from prominent research venues. Students work towards defining a research problem or a passion project of interest which they explore through various mediums including board-games, playable games, simulations, hardware artifacts (Arduino), user studies or other forms of gamified media. The course culminates in either (i) a high quality conference style paper which is potentially extendable to an external publication or (ii) a play-tested passion project/artifact accompanied by a written technical report.",
