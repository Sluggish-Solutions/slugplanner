    "description": "Introduction to software development in Python focusing on structuring software in terms of objects endowed with primitive operations. Introduces concepts and techniques via a sequence of concrete case studies. Coursework consists of programming assignments and a final examination. Note that CSE 30 assumes some Python experience, students trained in a different language should self-study Python to prepare for CSE 30. See CSE Testout Exam for resources and further information.",
