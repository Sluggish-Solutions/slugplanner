    "description": "Explores feminist theories from domestic U.S. and global contexts in order to ask how interventions of women of color in the U.S. and of radical feminist movements in non-U.S. locations radically re-imagine feminist politics. Rather than focusing on feminist movements that represent different regions of the world, course examines feminist theory through multiple histories of colonialism, post-colonialism, and globalization.",
